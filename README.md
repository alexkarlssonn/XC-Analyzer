TODO: Write some test code to test certain parts
TODO: Start using a debugger to test the code



Currently working on v0.2:
    Implementing the API calls for getting athletes by names
        TODO: Implement algorithm for finding matching names when searching through all athletes


GOAL WITH VERSIONS (push and create a branch for each version on github):
 * v0.2 - API calls for getting athlete
 * v0.3 - API calls for getting results (and results.json has been split into seperate files, maybe even remade how the db is structured?)
 * v0.4 - API calls for getting analyzed results (input fiscode for target athlete, and array of results: output will be an JSON object with all relevant analyzed data. Maybe?)
 * v0.5 - Backend cleanup, bugfix, test code. All API's implemented and works as intended
 * v0.6 - First version of super simple frontend. Can perform input to receive data from api calls

 * v1.0 - First proper release! Decent looking frontend. Can look up athletes and analyze his/hers results with decent looking statistics. Can also filter which results to analyze
