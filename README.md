TODO: Write a proper README


* Currenly on branch: wokring-on-next-version (v0.2)
  Merge with master and push once done. Then create a new branch v0.2 before starting to work on v0.3 


GOAL WITH VERSIONS (push and create a branch for each version on github):
 * v0.2 - API calls for getting athlete
 * v0.3 - API calls for getting results (and results.json has been split into seperate files, maybe even remade how the db is structured?)
 * v0.4 - API calls for getting analyzed results (input fiscode for target athlete, and array of results: output will be an JSON object with all relevant analyzed data. Maybe?)
 * v0.5 - Backend cleanup, bugfix, test code. All API's implemented and works as intended
 * v0.6 - First version of super simple frontend. Can perform input to receive data from api calls

 * v1.0 - First proper release! Decent looking frontend. Can look up athletes and analyze his/hers results with decent looking statistics. Can also filter which results to analyze
